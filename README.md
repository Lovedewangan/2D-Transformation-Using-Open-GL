# 2D Geometric Transformation Visualization Tool
Overview
This OpenGL-based application provides an interactive visualization of fundamental 2D geometric transformations, allowing users to explore how geometric shapes (specifically triangles) can be manipulated using various transformation techniques.
Features

Interactive 2D geometric transformations:

Translation: Move shapes along X and Y axes
Scaling: Resize shapes uniformly or non-uniformly
Rotation: Rotate shapes around their centroid
Reflection: Reflect shapes across X-axis, Y-axis, or origin
Shearing: Distort shapes along X or Y axes



Technical Details

Implemented using OpenGL and GLUT
Real-time visualization of transformation matrices
User-friendly interface with mouse and keyboard interactions
Support for entering precise transformation parameters

Transformation Techniques
Each transformation is implemented with the following characteristics:

Center-based transformations to maintain geometric integrity
Accurate matrix calculations
Visual representation of original and transformed triangle
Displays transformation matrix for educational purposes

User Interface

Main menu for selecting transformation type
Interactive point selection for triangle drawing
Input boxes for transformation parameters
Real-time preview of transformations
ESC key to return to main menu

Getting Started

Clone the repository
Compile with OpenGL and GLUT libraries
Run the executable
Select transformation type from main menu
Draw a triangle and apply transformations
